<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>
  Reducing the use of plastic is important because plastic production requires an enormous amount of energy andresources.This causes carbon emissions and contributes to global warming.Recycling plastic is not efficient - only 9% of plastic ever produced has been recycled.We're working for a more sustainable future by investing in solutions that can reduce plastic waste while lowering carbon emissions throughout the plastics lifecycle.By working together we can future our goal of ending plastic waste in the environment.
